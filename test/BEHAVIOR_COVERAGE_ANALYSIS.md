# Behavior Coverage Analysis

This document provides a comprehensive analysis of test coverage across all testing levels, identifies gaps, and ensures no behavior duplication.

## Testing Levels Summary

### Unit Tests (Isolated, Mocked Dependencies)
- **Location**: `test/unit/`
- **Characteristics**: Fast (milliseconds), all dependencies mocked
- **Purpose**: Test individual class logic in isolation

### Integration Tests (Multiple Units, Real Database)
- **Location**: `test/integration/`
- **Characteristics**: Moderate speed (100s of ms), real database, no UI
- **Purpose**: Test data layer interactions (Repository → Database)

### System Tests (Full Application, Real UI)
- **Location**: `test/system/`
- **Characteristics**: Slower (seconds), real widgets, real navigation, real database
- **Purpose**: Test complete user workflows through the UI

### End-to-End Tests (Production-like Environment)
- **Location**: `integration_test/`
- **Characteristics**: Slowest (10s of seconds), real device, everything real
- **Purpose**: Test critical user journeys on actual devices

## ❌ Coverage Gaps

### Integration Level Gaps

#### 1. Provider + Real Repository Integration
**Missing**: Integration tests for providers with real repositories and database
- ❌ SquirrelListProvider → SquirrelRepository → Database flow
- ❌ FeedingListProvider → FeedingRepository → Database flow
- ❌ Multi-repository workflows (e.g., delete squirrel cascades to feedings)

**Rationale**: Unit tests mock repositories, integration tests test repositories directly. Need to test provider logic with real data layer.

#### 2. Settings Repository Integration
**Missing**: Integration tests for settings persistence
- ❌ SettingsRepository save/load with real storage

### System Level Gaps

#### 2. Squirrel Detail View Workflows
**Missing**: `test/system/views/squirrel_detail_view_test.dart`
- ❌ Display squirrel details (name, age, weight, status)
- ❌ Tab navigation (Overview, Feedings, Care Notes, Weight Chart)
- ❌ Navigate to edit squirrel form
- ❌ Navigate to add feeding from detail page
- ❌ Navigate to add care note from detail page
- ❌ Delete squirrel confirmation dialog
- ❌ Display feeding records in list
- ❌ Display care notes in list
- ❌ Display weight chart

#### 3. Squirrel Form Workflows
**Missing**: `test/system/views/squirrel_form_test.dart`
- ❌ Create new squirrel form submission
- ❌ Edit existing squirrel form submission
- ❌ Form validation (required fields)
- ❌ Date picker interaction
- ❌ Development stage selection
- ❌ Status selection
- ❌ Cancel navigation
- ❌ Save and navigate back

#### 4. Feeding Form Workflows
**Missing**: `test/system/views/feeding_form_test.dart`
- ❌ Add feeding record form submission
- ❌ Edit feeding record form submission
- ❌ Form validation
- ❌ Weight calculations display
- ❌ Date/time picker interaction
- ❌ Food type selection

#### 5. Care Notes Workflows
**Missing**: `test/system/views/care_notes_view_test.dart`
- ❌ Display care notes list
- ❌ Add care note form
- ❌ Edit care note form
- ❌ Filter by note type
- ❌ Filter by importance
- ❌ Delete care note

#### 6. Weight Tracking Chart
**Missing**: `test/system/views/weight_tracking_view_test.dart`
- ❌ Display weight chart with data points
- ❌ Display weight statistics
- ❌ Date range selection
- ❌ Empty state when no data

#### 7. Feeding Schedule View
**Missing**: `test/system/views/feeding_schedule_view_test.dart`
- ❌ Display feeding schedule recommendations
- ❌ Display next feeding countdown
- ❌ Quick add feeding button
- ❌ Schedule updates based on weight

## 🔄 Potential Duplication Issues

### Issue 1: Provider Loading Logic
**Duplicated Behavior**: Loading squirrels from repository
- **Unit Test** (`squirrel_list_provider_test.dart`): Tests loading with mocked repository
- **System Test** (`home_view_test.dart`): Tests loading via UI with real provider + database

**Analysis**: 
- Unit test correctly tests provider logic in isolation
- System test correctly tests UI response to loading states
- **No duplication** - different aspects of the behavior tested at appropriate levels

### Issue 2: Data Persistence
**Single Coverage**: Repository CRUD operations
- **Integration Test** (`*_repository_test.dart`): Tests repository directly
- **System Test**: Does NOT re-test repository CRUD (correctly delegates to integration)

**Analysis**: 
- **No duplication** - system tests assume repositories work and test UI workflows

### Issue 3: Form Validation
**Future Concern**: When form tests are added
- **Unit Level**: Could test validation logic in form view models (if extracted)
- **System Level**: Will test validation through UI interaction

**Recommendation**: Keep validation testing in system tests unless validation logic is extracted to separate validators (then test validators at unit level).

## 📋 Action Items

### Phase 1: Integration Tests (Priority: High)
1. ✅ All repository tests complete
2. ⚠️ Add provider integration tests:
   - `test/integration/providers/squirrel_list_provider_integration_test.dart`
   - `test/integration/providers/feeding_list_provider_integration_test.dart`

### Phase 2: System Tests (Priority: High)
3. ⚠️ Add missing system tests (based on actual views that exist):
   - `test/system/views/squirrel_detail_view_test.dart` - Test 3-tab view (Info, Feeding, Progress)
   - `test/system/widgets/squirrel_form_test.dart` - Test squirrel add/edit form widget  
   - `test/system/widgets/feeding_form_test.dart` - Test feeding record add/edit form widget
   
   **Note**: care_notes, weight_tracking, feeding_schedule are not separate views - they're part of squirrel_detail_view tabs

### Phase 3: End-to-End Tests (Priority: Medium)
4. ⚠️ Setup E2E infrastructure
5. ⚠️ Implement core E2E tests:
   - Complete squirrel care workflow
   - Multi-squirrel management
   - Data persistence across app restarts
